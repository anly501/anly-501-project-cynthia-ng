        <p> Hello there - welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
		<p> I'm a first-year master's student in Data Science & Analytics at Georgetown University. I believe that investing in social impact is the most important value we can create. Growing up in Hong Kong exposed me to interconnections between local, Chinese, and international contexts, which shaped my approach to problems by linking seemingly disparate fields to derive new insights. As I continue to learn how to address social inequities, the habit of drawing connections has tied my undergraduate studies, research, and work together. Pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics (DSAN) at Georgetown University has helped me attain crucial tools and work with different people and disciplines to effect change in areas like pandemics and climate change. </p>
		<p> I first explored my interest in solving problems across disciplines by studying International Relations at Brown University. I took classes that taught me to apply statistical programming using R to analyze political problems and to use Python to write programs for data analysis and manipulate data structures. As COVID-19 spread across borders in the spring of 2020, my curiosity about how various nations harnessed data in responding to the pandemic inspired me to compare national information collection and sharing policies. Reflecting on my research, I wish I had the time and tools to model and predict the impact of policies on cases of COVID-19. To deepen my understanding of topics like this, I also completed Imperial College London’s Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra and am continuing with Multivariate Calculus on Coursera. </p>
		<p> The wide applications of data in my work also inspired me to further develop my skills in data science to stem the environmental impacts of large-scale meat production. In my last job, I analyzed the retail sales of meat alternatives by compiling and presenting data from multiple spreadsheets and portals regularly. This time-consuming process made me wonder how I could write a script to scrape, clean, and visualize specific data automatically. Also, the lack of transparency in the inventory and shipping statuses of products along our global supply chain, especially amid pandemic-related operational disruptions, strongly affected our strategy in promoting greener food options. Thus, I hope to further develop my skills to reliably quantify assumptions about the impact of various strategies on current and prospective sales. I look forward to continue applying skills in data science to strategize the expansion of social impact businesses.</p>
		<p> Overall, my past experience and feedback show that my strengths lie in:
		<ol>
			<li>Solving business-social problems. At plant-based social enterprise OmniFoods, I launched 3 plant-based products in 650+ stores in the US, making sustainable food options more accessible in the US. I also worked at a charity to develop child protection recommendations and worked in Congress to advocate for constituents. </li>
			<li>Analyzing data to build meaningful insights. At food delivery company Deliveroo, I analyzed sales that helped expand their special shared kitchens project. I also analyzed and forecasted sales data that helped OmniFoods target initiatives that increased monthly sales by 58%. </li>
			<li>Working with different people. I like understanding what matters to you, what problems you're facing, and how I can help. I lead a team of 40+ student leaders in GradGov to advocate for various issues. Previously at OmniFoods, I worked closely across teams to bring our exhibition in several trade events to life.</li>
		</ol>

			Outside of work, I thrive in engaging with my communities; currently, I'm the Advocacy Chief of Staff at GradGov, Georgetown's graduate student government. You'll also find me cooking plant-based food, going on morning runs along the Potomac river, scratching my head over word games, and jamming with friends.</p>
