        <p style="font-size:14px;"> Hello there - welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
		<p style="font-size:14px;"> I'm a first-year master's student in Data Science & Analytics at Georgetown University and previously did my undergraduate studies in International Relations at Brown University. After college, I worked at a plant-based company, where I expanded my interest in data analysis to expand sustainable plant-based options. My experience in NGOs, government, and start-ups has given me skills to tackle social problems across areas. </p>
		<p style="font-size:14px;"> My past experience and feedback show that my strengths lie in:</p>
			<ol style="font-size:14px;">
				<li>Solving business-social problems. At plant-based social enterprise OmniFoods, I launched 3 plant-based products in 650+ stores in the US, making sustainable food options more accessible in the US. I also worked at a charity to develop child protection recommendations and worked in Congress to advocate for constituents. </li>
				<li>Analyzing data to build meaningful insights. At food delivery company Deliveroo, I analyzed sales that helped expand their special shared kitchens project. I also analyzed and forecasted sales data that helped OmniFoods target initiatives that increased monthly sales by 58%. </li>
				<li>Working with different people. I like understanding what matters to you, what problems you're facing, and how I can help. I lead a team of 40+ student leaders in GradGov to advocate for various issues. Previously at OmniFoods, I worked closely across teams to bring our exhibition in several trade events to life.</li>
			</ol>
		<p></p>
		<p style="font-size:14px;"> Outside of work, I thrive in engaging with my communities; currently, I'm the Advocacy Chief of Staff at GradGov, Georgetown's graduate student government. You'll also find me cooking plant-based food, going on morning runs along the Potomac river, scratching my head over word games, and jamming with friends.</p>
