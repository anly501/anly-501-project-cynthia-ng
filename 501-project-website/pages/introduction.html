      Introduction
    </h1>

    <p>
      My interest in the diversity in companies' sprung from my interest in the experiences of people like me. I was born and raised in Hong Kong where I grew up around many people who looked like me. It was only until I moved to the United States for college that I became more conscious of my identity. It was not only because phrases I always used, like "taking the lift" and "revising for school", were British English phrases that were unfamiliar to most Americans, but also because I ended up being in spaces where I stood out. As I went through college and through the workforce, especially amid the #MeToo movement, I realized the conscious, collective effort it takes to ensure diversity and representation of people from different identities. Particularly, I am interested in learning about how to increase representation of people from marginalized backgrounds, especially women of color. 
    </p>
    <p>
As I grew up, it seemed like the world became more and more inclusive. There is a mainstream shift to the collective intention and efforts to ensure that various identities are respected, valued, and included in the workplace and in society. In recent years, this has come in the rising interest in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the workplace. However, with more visibility and embrace of DEI initiatives comes the opportunity to understand to what extent companies are actually implementing their goals and commitment to DEI. In addition, the tech industry, like many other industries, remains a largely male-dominated and white space. As a woman of color, I'm especially interested in learning about how equitable HR practices are in various tech companies, and how we can improve these HR practices. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a diverse workforce does not just only mean representation for more people from marginalized backgrounds, but also sends the signal to people that a company is welcoming. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">study</a> conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2019 reaffirmed the business case for gender diversity: companies in the first quartile for gender diversity on senior leadership were 25 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the lowest quartile. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This project examines the main question, "How diverse are public companies' workforces today?" While most people would likely agree on the importance of DEI initiatives, the types, levels, and measurements of DEI approaches vary by individual, leader, and company. Specifically, I'm interested in researching the equitable outcomes as opposed to just the DEI goals or plans in various companies to better understand just how diverse, equitable, or inclusive a company or industry is. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, this project examines the intersection of race and gender because examining the unique intersection of racism and sexism can provide insights into these two key aspects of identity without compromising depth of analysis. As a woman of color, I have a personal interest in learning more about the intersection of race and gender. While gender and race in the workplace provide meaningful slices of identity, in no way does this scope attempt to represent or replace many other aspects of identity – including disability, age, neurodiversity, national origin, documented status, and sexual orientation to name but a few. In addition, please note that insights from this study should not be generalized across the experiences of people of different races and genders in the workplace, as ultimately there are countless meaningful differences between individuals within the same social identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project hypothesizes that women of color earn less and have lower seniority than white men. Numerous studies that point to a gender pay gap (see <a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts>Pew Research Center’s study in 2020</a>), informing my hypothesis. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To test this hypothesis, this project primarily analyzes record data on six public companies provided by <a href=https://www.reveliolabs.com>Revelio Labs</a>, a company that gathers data on workforce dynamics. This project also analyzes data gathered via API from Twitter and Wikipedia on the same six companies.
