		Workforce Record Data from Revelio Labs
	</h2>
		<p>My primary dataset is record workforce dynamic data retrieved from Revelio Labs.
		<br>
		<br>
		I was determined to find company-level demographic data since the data would help me examine the topic best. I was disappointed when I conducted the data gathering process and realized that it was very difficult to discover company-level employee demographics data, which is understandably sensitive and thus inaccessible. I first tried and exhausted other options in finding company-level demographic data, including attempting using Glassdoor and Indeed APIs. I even contacted employees and Glassdoor and Indeed to check if they have API access, to no avail, and learned from them that the data is not publicly available. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When I felt like I exhausted all my options, I came across Revelio Labs––a startup founded on the basis that workforce dynamic data should be open and accessible. Revelio Labs specifically builds tools that ingest, integrate, and display publicly available workforce dynamic data. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I felt very lucky to have come across Revelio Labs, but quickly learned that they does not have open or public access to their backend data. As a result, I cold-messaged several of their employees on LinkedIn. Paulina Aceves, Research Analyst at Revelio Labs, responded and sent me three large samples of Revelio Labs' employee workforce demographic data. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Together, the three datasets from Revelio Labs totalled 28.6 million rows of data and 4.67 GB of data. That is why I am unable to host the data on GitHub or GU Domains, and have linked the AWS downloading link to the data in the data tab. Please find screenshots and descriptions of the data below:
		<br>
		<br>
		1. First, we have workforce dynamics broken down by demographics. There are 7.4 million rows of data with distinct columns 'company', 'region', 'seniority', 'job_category', 'gender', 'ethnicity', 'month', 'count', 'inflow', 'outflow', and 'salary'.

		2. Next, we have workforce dynamics broken down by role. There are 6.8 million rows of data and the csv file is 1.16 GB large.

		3. Finally, we have workforce dynamics broken down by geographic. There are 14.6 million rows of data and the csv file is 2.39 GB large.

	</h2>
		<p>To further understand workforce dynamics and sentiment, I gathered Tweets data via Twitter API in R. I used the R packages rtweet and twitteR in particular to scrape Tweets via API. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I read the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret from a .txt file. I then used the rtweet package to scrape Tweets data from Twitter. I used the search_tweets() function to scrape Tweets data from Twitter.
